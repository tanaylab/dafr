# dafr - Data in Axes in Formats for R

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of dafr is to provide R bindings for the [DataAxesFormats.jl](https://github.com/tanaylab/DataAxesFormats.jl) Julia package, which provides a uniform generic interface for accessing 1D and 2D data arranged along some set of axes. This is a much-needed generalization of the [AnnData](https://github.com/scverse/anndata) functionality.

The dafr package enables R users to access `Daf` data using familiar R interfaces while leveraging the powerful implementation provided by the Julia package. The package follows a functional interface similar to the Julia implementation.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dafr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tanaylab/dafr")
```

Note that dafr requires the Julia programming language and the DataAxesFormats.jl package to be installed. The package uses [JuliaCall](https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall) to interface with Julia from R.

## Usage

The R package provides an interface similar to the Julia package, with functions that mirror the Julia API:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(dafr)
# Setup connection to Julia
setup_daf()
```

```{r run_setup, eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
library(dafr)
setup_daf()
```

```{r example_data, eval=TRUE}
# Create a DAF object in memory
daf <- memory_daf("example")

# Add axes
add_axis(daf, "obs", c("cell1", "cell2", "cell3"))
add_axis(daf, "var", c("gene1", "gene2"))

# Add vector data
set_vector(daf, "obs", "score", c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9))

# Add matrix data
mat <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
set_matrix(daf, "obs", "var", "counts", mat)

# Access data
get_vector(daf, "obs", "score")
get_matrix(daf, "obs", "var", "counts")

# Get a dataframe view
get_dataframe(daf, "obs", c("score"))
```

## Querying Data

One of the powerful features of dafr is its query language. You can use queries to access and transform data flexibly. The package provides a convenient `[` operator for concise query syntax:

```{r query_setup, eval=TRUE}
# Create a sample dataset
daf <- memory_daf("query_examples")
add_axis(daf, "cell", c("A", "B", "C"))
add_axis(daf, "gene", c("X", "Y", "Z"))
set_vector(daf, "cell", "age", c(1, 5, 10))
set_vector(daf, "cell", "type", c("T", "B", "NK"))
set_scalar(daf, "version", "1.0")
set_matrix(daf, "cell", "gene", "counts", matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3))

# Basic queries using the [ operator
# Get scalar values
daf[": version"] # Get a scalar

# Access axes and properties
daf["? axes"] # List all axes
daf["/ cell ?"] # List properties of the "cell" axis

# Access vector data
daf["/ cell : age"] # Get the "age" vector for all cells

# Access matrix data
daf["/ cell / gene : counts"] # Get the full counts matrix

# Filter data
daf["/ cell & age > 2 : type"] # Get types of cells with age > 2

# Transform data
daf["/ cell : age % Abs"] # Get absolute values of ages
daf["/ cell : age % Log base 2"] # Get log2 of ages

# Aggregations
daf["/ cell : age %> Max"] # Get maximum age
daf["/ cell : age %> Mean"] # Get mean age

# Complex operations can be built using the pipe operator or query functions
query <- Axis("cell") |>
    And("age") |>
    IsGreater(2) |>
    Lookup("type")
daf[query] # Get types of cells with age > 2
```

The query syntax follows a simple pattern:
- `/ axis` selects an axis
- `: property` retrieves a property
- `% operation` applies an element-wise operation
- `%> reduction` applies a reduction operation
- `& property` filters by a property
- `= value`, `> value`, etc. apply comparison operations

See the Julia [documentation](https://tanaylab.github.io/DataAxesFormats.jl/v0.1.2/queries.html) for more details about the query language.

### Important Note About Data Copying

Due to limitations in JuliaCall, data is copied between R and Julia during function calls. This means that operations involving large matrices or vectors will incur memory overhead. For large datasets, consider performing more operations directly on the Julia side to minimize data transfers.

## Key Features

The dafr package inherits the key features of DataAxesFormats.jl:

- Support for both in-memory and persistent data storage
- Thread-safe implementation using read/write locks
- Ability to import and export AnnData objects
- Support for views and adapters
- Chaining repositories for efficient reuse of data
- Flexible data model based on axes, vectors, matrices, and scalar data
- Explicit support for grouped axes
- Simple query language for common operations
- Control over data layout and support for both dense and sparse matrices

## Status

This package is in early development. The API is subject to change based on user feedback. Comments, bug reports, and PRs are welcome!

### Future Plans

In future releases, we plan to implement a dplyr-like API for dafr to make it even more intuitive for R users. This will allow you to use familiar verbs like `filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, and `summarize()` with dafr objects, combining the power of the Julia implementation with the ergonomics of the tidyverse.
