\title{Collect group members from group indices}
\usage{
collect_group_members(group_indices)
}
\arguments{
\item{group_indices}{An integer vector where element i contains the group index
for entry i. A value of 0 indicates the entry belongs to no group.}
}
\value{
A list of integer vectors, where each vector contains the indices of
entries belonging to that group
}
\description{
Given a vector where each element is a group index for the corresponding entry,
returns a list of vectors containing the indices of entries in each group.
}
\details{
This is the inverse operation of assigning group indices. It's useful
for converting a per-entry group assignment into a per-group member list.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# If entries 1,3 are in group 1, entry 2 is in group 2, entry 4 is in no group
group_indices <- c(1L, 2L, 1L, 0L)
members <- collect_group_members(group_indices)
# Returns: list(c(1L, 3L), c(2L))
}
}
