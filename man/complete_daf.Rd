\title{Complete chain of Daf repositories}
\usage{
complete_daf(leaf, mode = "r", name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{leaf}{Path to the leaf repository, which will be traced back through its ancestors}

\item{mode}{Mode to open the repositories ("r" for read-only, "r+" for read-write)}

\item{name}{Optional name for the complete Daf object}
}
\value{
A Daf object combining the leaf repository with all its ancestors
}
\description{
Open a complete chain of Daf repositories by tracing back through the \code{base_daf_repository} property.
Each repository in a chain contains a scalar property called \code{base_daf_repository} which identifies
its parent repository (if any).
}
\details{
If mode is "r+", only the first (leaf) repository is opened in write mode.
The \code{base_daf_repository} path is relative to the directory containing the child repository.

See the Julia \href{https://tanaylab.github.io/DataAxesFormats.jl/v0.1.2/complete.html}{documentation} for details.
