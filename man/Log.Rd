\title{Log query operation}
\usage{
Log(base = exp(1), eps = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{base}{Base of the logarithm (default is e â‰ˆ 2.718)}

\item{eps}{Small value added to avoid log(0) (default is 0)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments needed to support usage of pipe operator}
}
\value{
A query operation object that can be used in a query sequence
}
\description{
Element-wise operation that converts every element to its logarithm.
This operation preserves the shape of the data (scalar, vector, or matrix) but
changes each value to its logarithm with the specified base. See the Julia
\href{https://tanaylab.github.io/DataAxesFormats.jl/v0.1.2/queries.html#DataAxesFormats.Operations.Log}{documentation} for
details.
