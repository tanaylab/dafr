\title{Get dictionary of axis entries to indices}
\usage{
axis_dict(daf, axis)
}
\arguments{
\item{daf}{A Daf object}

\item{axis}{Name of the axis}
}
\value{
A named vector mapping entry names to their 1-based indices
}
\description{
Returns a named vector that maps axis entry names to their corresponding integer indices.
}
\details{
This function returns the mapping between entry names and their positions
along the axis. This is useful for efficient lookups when you need to convert
between names and indices repeatedly.
In R, indices are 1-based (first element has index 1), consistent with R conventions.
See the Julia \href{https://tanaylab.github.io/DataAxesFormats.jl/v0.1.2/readers.html#DataAxesFormats.Readers.axis_dict}{documentation} for details.
